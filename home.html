          <li>Improves Social and Communication Skills</li>
            <p>traveling-broaden-horizons.One of the main benefits of travelling, especially to areas where your native language is not widely used, is that you learn how to communicate better with other people. Brushing up your knowledge on the most commonly used phrases or questions tourists ask can help you reach out to and relate better with the locals.</p>
            
            <li>Ensures Peace of Mind</li>
           <p> We all have stress and tension in our lives. Traveling forces us to temporarily disconnect from our normal routine, helping us appreciate the people and things we have around. As per a famous saying “we never know what we have until we lose it.”
            </p>
            <li> Helps You Get Original and Creative Thoughts</li>
            <p>It is believed that if someone gets out of their comfort zone, the mind gets more creative. To develop new neural connections that trigger original and creative thoughts, you must explore new places and break out of your daily routine.
            </p>
             <li>Broadens Your Horizons</li>
            <p>Travelling helps you connect with different people from different cultures. This gives you the opportunity to see issues and daily life challenges from a different angle.
            </p>
             <li>Enhances Your Tolerance for Uncertainty</li>
              <p>While travelling, you will find yourself stuck in situations where things don’t always go as planned. Such situations will help you learn to cope with the uncertainties in life.
            </p>            
              <li>Boosts Up your Confidence

            </p>            
              <li>Gets You Real-life Education</li>
              <p>Meeting different people from vast cultures and societies provides an education that is impossible to get in a traditional school, college or a university. There is no substitute for the real thing.
            </p>            
              <li>Creates Memories for Lifetime</li>

              <p>No matter how young or old you are, there is always a time when the child in you wants to have some fun. When you travel, you do not care what you do at all and you can just break free from the norm.
            </p>            
              <li>Aids you Get to Know Yourself</li>
              <p>While traveling, you might find yourself stuck in situations you won’t normally experience in your daily life. This can help you understand yourself and how you react to such circumstances, preparing you for future similar situations.
                Although traveling offers many benefits, it also has some disadvantages if not planned carefully. If you are a patient and taking medication for a disease, do not forget to carry your medication. Keeping jet lag pills handy saves you from unnecessary discomfort.
                Those susceptible to allergies should carry allergy medication. Plan your tour in advance, prepare a checklist to keep yourself healthy while traveling, and pack important items before you travel.</li>
